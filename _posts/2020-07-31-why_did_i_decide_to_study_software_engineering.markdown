I beleive coding is the future. I've always had an interest in coding and software engineering. I currently work as a telecommunications engineer but in my heart, I still want to become a software developer. 

I want to become a software developer because I want to create programs that help people and I would also love to create programs that will entertain people. I've always wanted to build a program from the first line to full integration. 
I am currently in college, but it will take me 4 to 5 years to get my bachelor's degree. I don't want to wait that long to get a degree in software engineering plus I donâ€™t have a lot of time. 
I like the fact that this program gets you going first then charge later. I am older now and time is very important so when I saw this would only take a couple of months, that made me happy I don't have to wait so many years before I can start working as a software developer.
