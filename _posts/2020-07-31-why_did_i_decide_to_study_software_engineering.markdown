I believe that coding is the future. I have always had an interest in coding and software engineering. I currently work as a telecommunications engineer, but in my heart, I still want to become a software developer. 

I want to become a software developer because I want to create programs that help people, and I would also love to develop programs that will entertain people. I've always wanted to build a program from the first line to full integration. I sometimes right-click in chrome to look at the code even though I did not understand what I was looking at, I would google some of the code to learn what it meant, but I realized the best way to learn how to code faster was to go to school.

Software developers are going to be needed in the future as technology continues to advance.
